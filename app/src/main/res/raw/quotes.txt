“Limiting one’s desires actually helps to cure one of fear. ‘Cease to hope … and you will cease to fear.’ … Widely different [as fear and hope] are, the two of them march in unison like a prisoner and the escort he is handcuffed to.

Both are mainly due to projecting our thoughts far ahead of us instead of adapting ourselves to the present.”
― Seneca , Letters from a Stoic
“You should … live in such a way that there is nothing which you could not as easily tell your enemy as keep to yourself.”
